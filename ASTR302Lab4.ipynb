    "The basic idea behind model testing is to compare the model to the data utilizing the uncertainties. For example the model may predict a value of 10, the data may say 12. Is this in agreement or not? Well, it depends on the measurement uncertainty -- if the measurement is $12\\pm 3$, then the model is discrepant **less than at the 1$\\sigma$ level** and so consistent with the model. On other hand if the measurement is $12 \\pm 0.1$, then the model is 20$\\sigma$ discrepant and therefore highly discrepant. Scientific inference is all in the uncertainties!\n",

    "To quantify this comparison we sum the differences between model and data for as many measurements as are available and that sum is called $\\chi^2$:\n",

    "Remember that you can only exclude models, never confirm. It is also very dangerous to say that one model is better than another by directly comparing $\\chi^2$ values. There are ways of doing this type of comparison, but simply comparing $\\chi^2$ values is not one of those ways.\n",

Lets see how we can fix this and get some intuition on the damage we could have done. To do this we will need a function fitter that offers a bit more flexibility. We will use scipy.curfit. As the name implies, this can fit an arbitrary curve, but we can certainly use it to fit a line."
